# hello-world
A test repository
Timbooms are like Tiggers, only they eat more pies. They program in SQL and Python, VB if absolutely unavoidable.
Timbooms have been known to misspell words.
Some Timbooms work from their local machines and try to upload to Github.
This continued on, until I downloaded from Github to PyCharm.

Procedure:
1. Open a branch on the client VCS->VCS Ops popup->Branches->New branch (or checkout, per below)
2. Changes made
3. VCS operations popup commit (fill in comment) - drop-down to push at same time
3a. Can get commits alone to Github with VCS->Git->Push and select the Commit.
        This is exactly the same effect as step(4) below.
4. VCS operations popup push (creates pull request)
5. Create pull request on the Github side
6. Fill in comment body on the github side.
7. Merge and delete branch on the Github side.
8. Note that Trello displays the status "Merged" on the front of the card.

This line is "Controlled by Trello card" - meaning that:
a. A card was created in Trello with the task
b. A branch was created in Github.
c. The branch was attached to the Trello card.
d. The branch was "pulled" into PyCharm,
       using VCS->Git->Pull then "refresh" button then pick from "Branches to merge" list
e. The remote branch is "Checked out".
f. Procedure above followed. 

New plan:
At work, I have to use VS, so it makes sense to do my own work this way too. Stiil no home stuff on the work computer and vice versa.

{Trying to see if we can get commits to Github thence to Trello}
{Add a second commit to the same branch to see what happens (prior to merge)
{No issue reference available in PyCharm. Try to get into pull.}

{Now in Visual Studio b/c I don't want to lear in multiple environments'}
