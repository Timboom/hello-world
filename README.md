# hello-world
A test repository
Timbooms are like Tiggers, only they eat more pies. They program in SQL and Python, VB if absolutely unavoidable.
Timbooms have been known to misspell words.
Some Timbooms work from their local machines and try to upload to Github.
This continued on, until I downloaded from Github to PyCharm.

Procedure:
1. Open a branch on the client VCS->VCS Ops popup->Branches->New branch (or checkout, per below)
2. Changes made
3. VCS operations popup commit (fill in comment) - drop-down to push at same time
4. VCS operations popup push (creates pull request)
5. Create pull request on the Github side
6. Fill in comment body on the github side.
7. Merge and delete branch on the Github side.

This line is "Controlled by Trello card" - meaning that:
a. A card was created in Trello with the task
b. A branch was created in Github.
c. The branch was attached to the Trello card.
d. The branch was "pulled" into PyCharm,
       using VCS->Git->Pull then "refresh" button then pick from "Branches to merge" list
e. The remote branch is "Checked out".
f. Procedure above followed.
